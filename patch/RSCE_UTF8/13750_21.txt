Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew you were coming big brother!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You knew it... How did you
know we were coming?
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Because I'm always looking
out the window.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though it's so dark?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Little man, go upstairs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
But, why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
...you guys knew about
this, didn't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
...that the Draconis had crashed and
that my husband was already dead.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I don't think you know the story.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe there is no hope in 
this world anymore...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
The world is in this state, and my 
husband is no longer with us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure your husband is still
alive somewhere. And we'll 
save the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
You're kind and strong...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I'm on it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
But... you're a liar.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not true...
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh!	I know you, big brother!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
You're on a quest to 
save the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it's embarrassing when
you say it like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Because I'm always looking
out the window.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw you guys coming 
from the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's so dark, and you're looking out?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Little man, go upstairs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
But, Why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
...it was you guys, wasn't it?

[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
...My husband was a crew 
member of the Draconis.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...which means he's already...

[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard. I heard that you
were riding the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe there is no hope in 
this world anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
The world is in this state, and my 
husband is no longer with us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure your husband is still
alive somewhere. And we'll 
save the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
You're kind and strong...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I'm on it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
But... you're a liar.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But whether we were there or not, 
it didn't make a difference.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
That boy looks out the window
every day and waits for his 
father to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Whenever I find someone who even 
remotely resembles my husband, I 
come home with a bang.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
"Mom, Dad's home! he says.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, then, he's going to
tell you about his father.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Mom!
Father's home!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy, there's something
I need you to hear...

[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
But father!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, listen to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
No, my dad!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Your father, you know.
He's dead...
[ENDBLOCK]
Father
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, come on. You're not going to
tell him I'm dead, are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
You!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, Dad!
You're back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
You're alive!
[ENDBLOCK]
Father
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course. It's my duty to  be around 
to make my wife and children happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
You!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, let's go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
The boy misses his father.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
My husband has been away
at work for some time now.
I'm getting a little worried.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been asking the military
about my husband, they won't
tell me anything...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Even in a world like this, I feel
I can make it if I have a family.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please do your best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please do your best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Please Dad, I'm tired of
waiting for you to come home!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
My father hasn't come home for
a long time. What's wrong with him?
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, where's Dad?
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm happy you're here, Daddy!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
