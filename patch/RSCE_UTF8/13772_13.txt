Yo, it's been a while!
How was Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you may have mistaken 
me for someone else.

Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, stop jerking my chain.
I want to hear about your travels.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure you're
not the same guy?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry about that.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's alright no harm, no foul.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do I really look that similar
to this gentleman you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you could be twins.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If anyone who knew him saw you,
they would have quite the reaction.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Although last time I saw him, he
sure left town in quite a rush...
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If you want to know more about
him, you should find his friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I bet they'd mistake you
for him just like I did.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Wasn't that big hairy guy
with you the other day?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Next time you see him,
give this to that man.

Oh, did you stop braiding?
It was looking good on you.

It's been so noisy these
days. I have my grandson
practicing swordsmanship.
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Leader
[ENDBLOCK]
My grandson seems to be
interested in swordsmanship. I
can only hope for the best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Leader
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm grateful to you, my heroic
friend, for acting as my guide.
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Leader
[ENDBLOCK]
My grandson will rise in the
world. He has learned
swordsmanship from the heroes.

make use of them for the world.

Village Leader's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I want my son to study more just
than sword fighting...
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Leader's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
That trio of "self-proclaimed"
heroes is one hell of a bunch of
crooks.
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Leader's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
And yet, she and your father
were so enthralled...
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Leader's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
If this happens, I won't be able
to talk about swordsmanship or
study.
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Leader's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Those three "self-proclaimed"
heroes, weren't they really
trying to escape?
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Leader's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I was relieved to hear that the
soldiers from the castle
would be coming.
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Leader's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought that those three "self-
proclaimed" brave men were
not enough

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
