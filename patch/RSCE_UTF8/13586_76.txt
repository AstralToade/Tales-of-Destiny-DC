<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Alba>!
Didn't <Chelsea> come back yet?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She came a little while ago.
She's lying down on his room.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
なあに、心配せんでも
大丈夫じゃよ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
とにかく、こちらに。

[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
なるほどの。そんな事が
あったのか……
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>は、一体、
どうしたんでしょう？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She may act like an adult,
but she's still a child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
張りつめた神経が、
ふいに緩んだのじゃろう。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
前から気になっていたんですが、
<Chelsea>はなぜ、大人ぶるんですか？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
そうじゃな、共に旅を続けるのであれば、
<Chelsea>の事、知っておいてもらった方が
よいじゃろう。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Her parents died when
she was still a child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then i took care of her.
But, she blame herself
for her parents death.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't really anyone's fault.
It was just an epidemic.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, the easiest way to
understand the death of her
parents, was to blame herself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
自分が子供だから、
両親を死なせてしまったと。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>さんのせいにする訳でもなく、
<Chelsea>は、本当に優しい子ですね。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
じゃが、それはとても悲しい事じゃ。
子供が子供でおられないなんての。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
せめて、この旅が終われば、
普通の子供に戻って欲しいのう……
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>さん……
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>などやめて、
同年代の男の子に興味を持たんかの？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>さん？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
そうじゃ、<Stahn>君。
誰か<Chelsea>と同い年の男の子は、おらんか？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
この際、容姿は問わん。
あっ、ただ弓の才能がある子でじゃ！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
すみません。
俺の村、子供が少ないんで。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
よかった、<Chelsea>。
もう大丈夫なの？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
……ごめんなさい、<Stahn>さん。
わがまま言ってしまいました。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
何言ってるんだよ。
<Chelsea>はまだ子供なんだから
無理しなくていいよ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
私、子供じゃありません！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
ダメだよ！
<Chelsea>はまだ子供なの!!
分かった？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
は、はい……
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is all
grown up now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's not the spoiled
brat she was back then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is all

[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's not the spoiled
brat she was back then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't always
been spoiled!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you don't mind me
saying that, do you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even <Woodrow>,
that's terrible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did something happen
to you before?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually <Stahn>,That's about the
time that <Chelsea> and I met.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
At first, <Chelsea>
hated <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, that's not true!
I've always loved you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, I can't imagine what
<Chelsea> must be like now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Stahn>, You haven't 
been listening, have you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
At the time, Master was visiting
the castle to teach me archery.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't let the young <Chelsea>
stay at home, so I went with
her to the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I was busy teaching <Woodrow>,
so I couldn't help <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, was very upset 
with <Woodrow> about that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then, one day, <Chelsea>
jumped on me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was crying
and sniffling.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I said, "Don't make
fun of my family!"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't long after that,
that <Woodrow> started to
treat me as a distraction...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
That...was
difficult.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, that's terrible!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd be hurt too if
<Lilith> did that to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I would never do that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aw, that's terrible <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahahaha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh. Thank you for taking
care of me at Frostheim.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you forget
about me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I asked you to help <Chelsea>
and <Woodrow>, didn't I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, that old man? I didn't know
he lived this deep in the mountains.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
The situation in Heidelberg
has calmed down.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm the only one
that came back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aren't <Chelsea> and
<Woodrow> with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
As for <Woodrow>that is,
<Chelsea> is still at Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I you want to, you 
can show your face.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure you'll
be pleased.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I'm ever in Heidelberg,
I'll stop by.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>There is a splendid makeup table.
However, the essential cosmetics
are quite few...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, boy? why have
you come to see me again?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, Where have we met?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps <Chelsea> is in
the Hills behind the house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks in advance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're tired, you can rest.
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps <Chelsea> is in

[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks in advance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of <Chelsea>
for me, will you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Be careful on your way to Janos.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're tired, you can rest.
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be too hard on yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long way to Janos. Don't
be too hard on yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
The situation has calmed
down a lot. This is how
I was able to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is still at the castle.
You can go and visit if you like.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is still at the castle.
You can go and visit if you like.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why <Woodrow>, Did you throw
away your right as king?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm only kidding, hahaha,
take care of <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>. Be carefull, my dear.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you all, for your
support of <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If there is anything I can
do to help, let me know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even an old man like me
can be of use sometimes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!It's nice
to see you again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, who are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please come back
and visit us again.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
