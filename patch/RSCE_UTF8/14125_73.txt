I'm pretty sure you're ...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Me?

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Clown...
I'm not...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh, I know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks for that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
What have you learned from
running around playing that
useless music?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell? Cat's got your 
tongue all of a sudden?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I really hate careless
people like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know if you're a 
friend of Master <Fayte>'s or 
what, but I don't like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
And while I appreciate your
help in rescuing Master <Fayte>...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I refuse to let you go anywhere
else with him.
I won't tolerate it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?	Do 
they hate me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems there's been an
incident at that house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, what's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's been a bit of an incident.
One of my soldiers was attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who did it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, they've been caught...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong?
You don't look happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, are you saying
this girl attacked the soldier!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Fayte>!
I'm not the one who did it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>, please believe me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe such a small child
would have attacked a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe it either.
Such a small girl...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>, please
help me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems I'll have to get involved.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, can you wait a bit before
you deal with her?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. But, I'll take her
into custody for now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't you ask around
in Moreau for more info?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There might be some people
who know about the attack.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The incident took place at dawn. A
soldier was attacked in Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, there's been similar
incidents in the past few days.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The soldiers attacked were left
with two scratches on their bodies.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Based on the soldiers' testimony
and witnesses, we concluded that
the girl was the culprit.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
However, there was a witness who saw
the girl at the time of the incident.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I think that's why Mr. <Fayte> 
gave you all the time you needed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story, but would you like
to hear a summary of the case?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I heard about the attack.
But she was playing with her cat
under the house at that time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
She was dressed in
Shiden gear. I'm sure she'll stand
out. Besides, she was talking 
to the cat really loudly.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Can she really talk to a cat?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a girl? Yeah, I was
at the store at that time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
She was looking for quite a while, and
when I thought she made up her mind
and started to wrap the product, she
said she wanted something different.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
I remember it well, because I've done 
it so many times.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, I saw a girl causing a
scene in the fish shop at the harbor.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I was kind of curious, so I came
straight back to this inn.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
As soon as I got home, I opened the
sliding door and there was the girl,
who was supposed to be at the port.
Came from near the weapons shop.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no such thing as a secret
passage in this city that no one 
knows about. It's a mystery.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you find the culprit?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Now please go inside
and brief <Fayte> on
the situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... Well, when you do find
the culprit, please come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you like to hear
about the case?
Yes
No

What will happen to our school if

[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Since the arrival of the new governor,
the people in the castle have become
a bunch of scary people.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, I saw him adding
poison to a knife he was carrying.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Moreau's school is the best
in Aquaveil. The royalty of each
territory are also alumni.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It is well known that
<Fayte> and <Johnny>
fought over <Eleanor>.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
When I look at <Fayte> and 
<Rihanna> now. I think things
turned out for the best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The school has been closed.

[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte> said that from
now on, we will get along
with other countries.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
The weird thing floating in
the sky seems to be getting
bigger and bigger.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
He said he's rooting for you, too.
Good luck!

take care of it.

Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, guys, what did I

[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't tell anyone you're on
the side of justice. No, no,
no, it's not me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Everybody, calm down! This is
when the heroes come in!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
