When I was ordered to remain in
Cresta, I wondered why I was 
stationed to such a rural area.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought it would become my
permanent home. I don't even want
to return to the royal capital.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion> you are a better man
than the rumors make you out to be.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leader>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, what is that supposed to mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't mean anything by it. 
He's a really nice person, unlike
the rumors.

We are always ready to mobolize
though, just in case...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
When your adversary is in the sky,
there's no way to combat them!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you the one who reported the
unusual monster sighting?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yes, that was me...wait!
Aren't you the great Hedge Knight, <Lion>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's me. I've been sent here from
Darilsheid to investigate. Now,
tell me all the details.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow...Sir <Lion>... 
from the royal capital...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, snap out of it.
Stop wasting my time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir! It was just the other day.
A strange monster appeared.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I already know that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Get to the point!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a formidable opponent!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I need more than that. For instance,
when did you first see it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, uh, let's see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Forget it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
.........
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Moving on. What
kind of monster was it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, well, about that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! Tell me, did
you really see a monster?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeeaaannooomaybe!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have got to be kidding me...
Why would you give a false report?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't! I...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Was he trying to gain
recognition or something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can understand that, especially
when you're languishing in the 
middle of nowhere like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, no monsters have appeared?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
N...no, it's not like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's enough. You're still lying!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, I'm sorry. 
I'll tell you the truth.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that an unidentified
creature has appeared.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You heard...? In other words, you
haven't actually seen it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...That's correct.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
So who actually saw it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
She's a girl from the orphanage. 
I was threatened to report it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
A girl...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, she put a sword to my throat
and demanded I reported it. She
said she sensed something terrible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... This girl is 
at the orphange, correct?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Y...yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you know, I'm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry. I will report back
favorably. I don't understand why 
I'm doing this, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was oddly persuaded by your tale.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
