<IGNORE>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think there was an incident
at the house over there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, what's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's been a bit of an incident.
One of my Soldiers was attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So who did it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, the criminal
has been caught.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter?
You don't look so good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? <Fayte> is this the girl
who attacked the Soldier?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Please <Mr. Fayte>!
I'm innocent!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Please believe
me Mr. <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I certainly don't think such a small
girl could have attacked a Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
But then again...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe it either.
This girl is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Johnny> Please help me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't help, i'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, can you wait a moment to
discuss the treatment of this girl?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fine... Excuse me while 
I take this girl into custody.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Also, you should try asking 
around in the Moreau territory.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There might still be people who
know something about the incident.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The incident took place in the early
hours of yesterday. A Soldier was
attacked here in the Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
In fact, there's been many similar
incidents in the past few days.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The soldier that was attacked
had two scratches on him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
After reviewing the testimony of
the soldier who was attacked and
the stories of witnesses, we came
up with the girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I have an alibi that I saw
the girl at the time of the incident.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I think that's why Mr. <Fayte> 
gave you all the time you needed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story, but would you like
to hear a summary of the case?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I heard about the death.
But she was playing with her cat
under the house at that time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The guy that's dressed in
Shiden gear. I'm sure he'll stand
out. Besides he was talking 
to the cat in a big voice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Can he really talk to a cat?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a girl? Yeah, I was
at the store at that time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
He was looking for quite a while, and
when I thought he made up his mind
and started to wrap the product, he
said he wanted something different.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
I remember it well, because 
I've done it so many times.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, I saw a girl causing a
scene in the fish shop at the harbor.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I was kind of curious, so I came
straight back to this inn.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
As soon as I got home, I opened the
sliding door and there was the girl,
who was supposed to be at the port.
Came from near the weapons shop.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
No one know of a secret passage
in this city. It's a mystery.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you find out who did it?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, please go inside
and explain to Mr. <Fayte>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... Please come back
when you find the culprit.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
So you want to hear about the case?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you here to capture me
for disobeying ...<Tiberius>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...? No, I don't sense
any hostility from you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
This case will have a serious
impact on the relationship
between Moreau and Terazzi...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you wonder why I'm so calm? It's the
result of relentless spiritual practice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...The truth is, I'm too cowardly
to move. You guys can help me.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
