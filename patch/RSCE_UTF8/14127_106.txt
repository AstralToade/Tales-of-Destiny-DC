Young Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems there's been an
incident at that house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, what's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's been a bit of an incident.
One of my soldiers was attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know who did it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, we arrested
someone, alright.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong?
You don't look happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, are you saying
this girl attacked the soldier!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Fayte>!
I'm innocent!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>!
You have to believe me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is pretty hard to believe
a little girl would attack a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
But still...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe it either.
Such a small girl...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>!
Help me! Please!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, with the way she's pleading,
we've got no choice but to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, can you wait a bit
before you deal with her?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. We'll be
holding her here, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't you ask around
in Moreau for more info?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There may be people
who saw it happen nearby.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The incident took place at dawn. A
soldier was attacked in Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, this is just one of
many similar incidents, lately.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The soldiers who are attacked
are always left with two
distinct cuts on their bodies.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Based on the testimony of the
soldiers who were attacked, as well
as witness testimony, we concluded
that the culprit was this little girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
That said, another witness claims
to have seen the same girl
elsewhere when the attack took place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe that is why
Lord <Fayte> is allowing
you to investigate like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story, but would you like
to hear a summary of the incident?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I heard about the attack.
The girl they think did it
was playing with that
cat at the time, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Someone wearing clothes from Shiden
really sticks out here, you know?
Plus, she was being really loud.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if she can
really talk to cats...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
A little girl, huh?
Yeah, she was here buying
fish when the incident happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
She sure took up a lot of time.
Every time I started packing up
what she said she wanted, she'd
suddenly decide on something else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyone would remember
a weird customer like her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a while back, but I saw
a young girl making a fuss
at the fish market at the harbor.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I was kind of curious,
but I came right back to this Inn.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
After I got back here, I opened
up that sliding door, and saw what
had to be the same girl coming out
of that house by the weapons shop!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It's quite the mystery. There's not
a secret passage in this town
everyone else doesn't know about.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know who the culprit is!?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Then please head inside
and explain your 
findings to Lord <Fayte>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Please return
once you've concluded
your investigation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you like to hear
about the case?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant

is blocked, so now I can't leave.
[ENDBLOCK]

Young Prince? What 
are you doing here!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad you guys are okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I met a man from Seinegald
the other day. I was wrong in
thinking they were savages.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant

I'm a Terazzi local, but I had
nothing to do with this, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I can say now that <Tiberius> was
too forceful in its approach.
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
That broadcast completely
erased the existence of 
<Tiberius>, didn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that a good or bad thing? As a
person from the Terazzi territory,
it's complicated.
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what the Black
Cross Fleet, the pride of
Moreau, is doing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll have to get my lens out too.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Now, that object has 
changed to Terazzi.
It's not unreasonable,
is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that the head of
a huge company in Seinegald 
was working on this painting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't it possible that its head
is being manipulated by the 
royal family of Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

Until we can confirm the safety of
the royal family, we should do our
best to avoid making rash decisions.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Dear Gino, I am so sorry for not
being able to protect you...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
From now on, I'll support <Fayte>
and bring back the glory of Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte> advised me not to make a 
fuss, and to keep a cool head.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
To tell you the truth, I'm overflowing 
with anxiety, but I'll shut up and do
my job.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm willing to go through anything, if 
I can put the world back together.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! It's that really famous singer.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I was watching when you put
on one of your shows earlier.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I know you. Your friend is the
young Prince of Shiden, isn't he?
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
He said that the friend with the
flutter style, was the young Prince
of the Shiden territory.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Fayte>, hooray!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that floating in the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Is it really nighttime?
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Prince, you're so cool!
Keep up the good work!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
Keep up the good work!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are we fighting the
Terazzi territory? Aren't we
both a part of Aquaveil?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
With <Fayte> here, I'm sure you'll
get along with everyone. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Strange broadcasts, shadows in the
sky... I'm scared out of my mind...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]

What's an Aeth'er War anyway?

specific set method is as follows.
