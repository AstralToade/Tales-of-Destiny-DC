[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hahaha.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just a housewife's chat...
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you. I haven't seen your face
around here, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm from the city of
Cyril in Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, this is
your husband?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, am I !?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, my husband is
in Cyril.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right,
I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, don't worry. What are you
talking about here?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
It's already decided for the aunts'
well-end meeting!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Right now, I'm talking about
General <Dryden>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a little scary, isn't he?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it's true that some people
do think that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
But he's a very popular person
in Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That man?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. Even though he is a
civilian employee, he is the one
who thinks about safety and
happiness first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a surprising fact. The next
time we meet, We'll make fun of
this story.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Making fun of me, <Mary>...
Are you <Rutee> now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
It's hard to say to our customers,
but we are not currently
cashing lenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh, why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, this will run out of Gald.
[ENDBLOCK]

ask why!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It's hard to say to our customers,

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, we... that, I have to get
rid of my debt by tomorrow...
do I have to?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you going to do
with the question?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to get rid of our
debt right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Otherwise, there may not
be a tomorrow
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if you say so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I knew that I couldn't cash
it, so please tell me the reason.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
You can see it by going to the
house of General Oberon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>'s House?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...!

It seems that the platoon headed for

what happened?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, I was stabbed by
a bee on my way to the temple and
had a hard time.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion, don't forget to bring the
Panacea Bottle when you go.
[ENDBLOCK]

Don't forget your Panacea bottle

[ENDBLOCK]
This is <Lion>.
Thank you, for everything you do!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The city is peaceful again.
[ENDBLOCK]

As a result, I heard that it was
a battle that protected the world.

Hey Mama. Let's go on a picnic
next vacation.
[ENDBLOCK]

Recently, <Lion>'s fans have
increased, but I was the first
to like it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey Mama. Let's go on a picnic

[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
There are a lot of soldiers in
the city. I wonder why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish <Lion> could beat
all the bad guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I went to the castle and left the
lens. I was also helpful, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Lion>? I was just
talking about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You're <Lion>? Well, even if you
look closely, he's a beautiful boy!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard it, <Lion>!
It seems to have fulfilled
the great duty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, my God. Don't call out to me.
<Lion> is really cute.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw the rumored <Lion>.
Hey, he was a beautiful boy
who fell in love with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
According to the rumors of the
soldiers, <Lion> has played a
major role again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen <Lion> lately, I
wonder if he's gone somewhere
far away.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Where did <Lion>go in such
a difficult time?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
There are rumors that <Lion> was
a bad guy, but I don't believe it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Make a hole in that
damn outer shell!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You will never lose!

[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I want <Lion> to get ahead. It's
not the age of the Seven Generals
anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if I'll dry
my futon today.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I think <Lion> will be elected
for the Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I want <Lion> to get ahead. It's

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel that the
castle is busy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
The voice you hear from the sky
is familiar to you
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that it was the general
manager of Oberon that was
broadcasting from the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what will happen to
Seinegald from now on...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please. Make the world
a battle cry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Rumor has it that a vehicle called
the Draconis was attacked by monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that it was in the process
of carrying a very important secret!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if there are any interesting rumors. 
 I have no time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There are rumors that the two countries
have jointly buried something in
the hammers of Seinegald and Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Nowadays, wherever you go into the city,
you can carry it with <Lion> Magnus.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It's strange that you shouldn't be
rumored if you're an unidentified
young boy and you have a good arm.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if there are any interesting rumors. 
 I have no time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that the Draconis crashed
into the mountains...Is it okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you guys know the situation?
Tell me what's going on!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If the sunlight disappears, the
ground will freeze in a blink of
an eye...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you making a secret weapon
in the castle to pierce the
outer shell?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn, why... When I saw that
light, tears came out.

Well <Lion>, looks like we're in

I bet I can learn a lot
about the sword from you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a handshake!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Make no mistake.
You and I? We are NOT equals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't stand laid-back, careless,
overly-friendly people like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
As expected from the
promising Hedge Knight.
Won't even shake hands
with us filthy commoners, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Straylize Temple is
North of Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a village
called Armeida along the way.
Let's head for there, first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have my doubts about this person...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The inhabitants of the city
are also quite upset.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No wonder.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you were shown such an aerial
city and even attacked...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordian Masters! What the
hell is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow... such a huge building is
floating in the sky!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
And that intense light! What a
tremendous amount of technology!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, why are you so flirting
when your country is destroyed?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indiscriminate crustal fracturing
weapon Bergland.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the true nature of the
light released from Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The purpose is to destroy the ground,
as it is in the street.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
You said the aerial city was used
in the Tenchi war...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Aeth'er Wars...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I have no choice but to tell
you the truth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
A thousand years ago, there was a
great war involving all humankind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was the ground forces to which we
belonged and as such the Heavenly
Army of the aerial city.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
So the Aeth'er War...! It wasn't
just a legend, was it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni played 
a big role in the Aeth'er War.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was,"A sword caught in a
worldwide calamity".
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I 'm sorry I didn't
say anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
We wanted to erase the memory of
the Aeth'er war from the
history of mankind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not to repeat, the mistakes
of the past.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
But as a result, the aerial
city has been revived...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
People of the earthly world!
Do you see our power?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>...What are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
What you see above you is the
aerial city of the Aeth'er War.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
That we have revived from a
thousand years long sleep!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
We do not forgive at all.
No exceptions are allowed.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It does not allow the people of
the earthly world who can only
crawl on the ground like insects.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I will confine everything on the
earthly world to the darkness.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Please wait with trembling expectations!
Mwahahaha!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Hugo>. Are you going to pretend
to be the king of the heavenly
world!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
The way he talks is
like that man.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What should I do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if you use the Draconis, you
can not reach that aerial city...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there no way for us to compete?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No, not yet!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
As it is... Can I be left alone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can you hear me, <Hugo>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who will make you like it!
Who will do what you want!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will definitely be rewarded...!
<Lion>'s enemies will definitely be taken!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you understand!
Remember, <Hugo>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
That spirit, young master.
well said!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It can't be.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
That kind of...It can't be.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, this voice
is unmistakable.
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordian team, it's not a
case of depressed!
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
We still have the potential!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Who?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mercurius <Ritora>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was the one who once led
us as the commander of the
ground forces.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
In case of an emergency, I also
transcribed my personality to
the core crystal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where does your voice come from...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
The communication function that is
built into me is being used.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, I'm in the heart of Radisrol.
The strategy meeting is carried
out immediately from this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gather the Swordian team and
hurry to Radisrol!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is the first call order
in a thousand years.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure you'll get by, right?
We can still do something
about it, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, <Stahn> Aileron.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be afraid under any
circumstances! Use all means
to accomplish your mission!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the Swordian team!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, I understand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, let's head
right out away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have already picked up the sea
dragon. Try going outside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Radisrol was moved to the sea.
Waiting for arrival.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Excellency, I would like to
work with them to gather information.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, you have permission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whew. I thought I'd be able to
go home soon, but I didn't go
that way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have to see Atamoni's
Eye sealed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to the advice of the
Swordians, we were able to
create a perfect sealing facility.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
From now on, the armies of both 
our country and Seinegald will be
stationed there. Please rest assured.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I did everything I could do in
this era. I have no choice but
to believe it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I and <Chelsea>,
will return through Janos.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, please come visit us
again in Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Feel free to drop in at the castle.
You guys are always welcome.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please leave <Mary> and
others to us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure I'll go visit
them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Until then!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Then I will return to
the temple soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...It was really hard. Good work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't all like that. When it
was over, it was a fun trip.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
For me, who knew only inside
the temple, it was a good opportunity
to know the outside world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's because everyone gave me
an opportunity. I am grateful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Likewise. Thanks to you,
it really helped me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Well then, good luck.
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegald Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Stahn>. Excuse Me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must apologize, I'm sorry
I have to say goodbye, <Dymlos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The next time we meet, 
I'll be stronger. 
Please look forward to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no guarantee that I
will be here when you return.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I find a better person,
I'll switch quickly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jeez. You could feel a little sad
I'm going...Well then!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Ah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos> won't show it himself, either.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, what are you going to do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What else? I'll
await further orders.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've done a lot already. You
should take some time to rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Such is my duty
as a Hedge Knight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad I was able to travel with
you, <Lion>. We went through a lot,
but it was fun.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you mimic me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Come on, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all that, you still
dislike me that much?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I consider you to be
a good friend, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh..!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't waste your breath.
I'll say this one more time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't stand laid-back, careless,
overly-friendly people like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...But...fine, I suppose
I can make a small exception.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is kinda nice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
..Hmph.
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegald Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Stahn>, the Draconis is ready.
We can depart at any time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I should say goodbye to <Rutee>...
Wonder where she went?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw her in the
castle a while ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'll go look for her.
Excuse me, can you wait for a while?
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood.
[ENDBLOCK]

possible due to the absence
of Swordian.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a busy guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are <Stahn> and <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't butt in.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
But it's about young master's older sister.
Do you not care about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
... I don't care.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, <Rutee> and I are
essentially strangers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Rather than that. Let's go back
to the mansion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> is waiting.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
