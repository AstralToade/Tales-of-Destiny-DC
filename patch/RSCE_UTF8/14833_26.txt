Uncle Bob
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that you, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uncle Bob!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uncle Bob...?
I've heard that name before.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's Aunt Maggie's husband, from
Lienea. She said he was missing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, <Stahn> said he might
be living on the outer shell.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And he's really on the outer shell!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
See, I knew my hunch was right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But how did you stay alive?
[ENDBLOCK]
Uncle Bob
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say
good luck and these clothes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, Uncle. Aunt Maggie
was worried about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I think we should
go back right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
Uncle Bob
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you guys... have anything
to say about my outfit?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I've already seen
that kind of punchline.
[ENDBLOCK]
Uncle Bob
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yeah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll take you home. Let's 
go back to Lienea village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Uncle Bob
[ENDBLOCK]
That's great I was having trouble
getting back down there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, wait here. I'll send 
him back with the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I got it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That was fast. Was
your Aunt happy?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, he was very happy.
She also thanked me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome to Katz Village.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh. They're strange
people, aren't they?
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
The Katz People are the Katz
that were launched into the
sky during the bombardment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Rabbitz
[ENDBLOCK]
And we all live here 
together in peace.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But we're here to destroy
the outer shell.
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
.

[ENDBLOCK]
Rabbitz
[ENDBLOCK]
Behind me is a rocket made
up of parts from earth. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Rocket...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, what's a rocket?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't ask me. I have no
idea about that stuff.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, cute!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to hold you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a Katz with scary
eyes. This guy...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, isn't it nice~?
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
No, no, no! We're
already grown-up Katz.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Adults!
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, Katz! That's why I'm
not supposed to be held.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What an imbalance!
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
In exchange for a hug. I'll
give you something nice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, come here, Katz.
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Now anyone can feel like a
Katz. Katznip suit!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, hey, hey, tough...
...What the heck!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, <Mary>. It's
hard to fight with that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I'll wear it home.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm sure <Dalis> will
be pleased to hear that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...don't say, <Philia>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know...

...<S05>Ha! Hi.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I may look like this, but I used
to be a free spirit and traveled
all over the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Nyan? Do you know anyone
who looks like him?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone wants to travel in search of
freedom at least once in their life.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
From the looks of it, You and
your friends are not free.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It is only in the midst of inconvenience
that we can understand freedom.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I think it's important to take a
journey in search of freedom.

Apparently, You and your friends are
enjoying their freedom as well.

Even though I look like this,
I used to be a free spirit and

[ENDBLOCK]
Old Katz

[ENDBLOCK]
Old Katz

Everyone wants to travel in search of

Old Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
From the looks of it, You and your
friends are not free Katz.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It's good to be free, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Person
[ENDBLOCK]
I found myself 
in this place...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh no, it's really fun to be free
and travel around the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Person
[ENDBLOCK]
From the looks of it, you
are not free to go.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Nevertheless, it is only in the
