<TAG_005>Dear Diary, I want to be a teenager 
forever. I don't want to grow up...
[ENDBLOCK]
<IGNORE>

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are these the memories
trapped in this lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure,
Mr. <Baruk>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
You lied to Mr. <Lion> about not
knowing the whereabouts of the
shipment from Darilshied...
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
Why on earth would
you do that...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't need to know anything.
If you do, it will make you...
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
...It wouldn't matter if we stalled
<Lion> and the others here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's <Greybum> I'm worried about.
I hope the people in town didn't see it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, even if that were the case,
I don't think the people in this
town would tell them anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mr. <Baruk>, I heard that <Lion>
and his group left for Calviola...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... Keep me informed
if anything else happens.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir... why are you keeping
an eye on Mr. <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that what adults are supposed
to do, watch over the children?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew it, Mr. <Baruk> was in on it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But why did the Deputy and the
others go along with him?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If they didn't go along with him,
they might've put themself in danger.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, it's a man
who may kill them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, you did
become an adult...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that, 
I don't get it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Baruk>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not. Um,
who is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm <Stahn>, and you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
I beg your pardon. I'm the
one who works here now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm Nash,
It's a pleasure to meet you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash you said...
It's my pleasure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you want
to do, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Philia>.
Do you remember the 
name Nash anywhere?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash...?
Oh, I'm pretty sure it's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah! It's Elena's father
from Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know Elena?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
In fact, we do...
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. She wants to live with me,
not with her grandparents...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand.
I'll go meet Elena.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, That's a relief!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>There's nothing in it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
While companies are making profits, 
they should also contribute to the
community. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to support people here,
through the <Baruk> Foundation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll let you know if I get
any information. Until then,
you may stay here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish you hadn't been so reckless.
I'd be pissed off at General <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Baruk> is really hoping for
the development of Calvalese.
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Baruk> was unusually 
flustered when he found out
that you had left town.
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Baruk>... Where
have you gone?
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think Mr. <Baruk> will return.
I have a feeling he won't ever be back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't wait to be transferred
to Seinegald's headquarters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha!	What I just said?
Please don't tell anyone!
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
Hurry up to Seinegald's
headquesters. No, no, no.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk> is at Darilsheid's
headquarters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard Seinegald was attacked?
Is Oberon's headquarters okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if Mr. <Baruk> doesn't come back.
I will inherit his aspiration.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
