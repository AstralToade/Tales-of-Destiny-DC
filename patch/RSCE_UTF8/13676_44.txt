<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, there's a little bird.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are they trying 
to build a nest?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right. Every year, 
they lay their eggs on the roof
of our house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's wonderful. I'd love
to see that moment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm sure you'll see them leave
the nest again this year, so come 
by and check it out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, a nest is forming.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It used to be one bird,
but today it's two.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
This bird is very rare. The male
builds the nest first in order
to invite the mate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, so you're the
proactive type.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
You're a funny girl with
funny things to say.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just like when I stumbled
upon <Dalis>' house.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha-ha-ha. They're
both strange kids.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, <Mary>, that bird 
is still a newlywed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you say <Stahn>. We are
still more than those birds
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, there's only
one bird today.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that her husband?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like it's shift
change time, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Delivery?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, did you see that?
There's an egg!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I did see two eggs,
so they are twins.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm impressed.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I hope they'll hatch soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So the chicks were born.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
You were born well, even 
though the world is like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, weren't there
two eggs?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
The other egg 
didn't make it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope that at least the 
remaining chicks will leave
the nest in good health.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
I think it's time for 
you to leave the nest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're leaving
the nest!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've successfully
left the nest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, well, where's
the parent bird?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aren't you coming with us?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not going
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
After this, the parent birds
disappear together. And
they die together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know why, but I guess 
when you finish raising a child,
your role comes to an end.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
But even the child who has just
left the nest will die the same 
way next year.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
That's how the future is made.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, it's not sad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thoughts connect lives and
create the future. I wonder 
if that's what our role is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's something
in the nest.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
