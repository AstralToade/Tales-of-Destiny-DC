<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this a thought trapped
in the lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, shit!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can I help you,
Your Majesty the Great?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who the hell are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's just say that I'm
here to help you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you really think that
calling me Majesty the Great
will make me accept it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it is not. In fact,
you will be a great king.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
What, me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. Now,
please be aware.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, let's dethrone the 
Great King of Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
The reason is that he is accused
of giving the national treasure 
sword to Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
But there's no evidence. That's
not going to convince the people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is nothing to worry about.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
The boy with the treasure
sword will be here soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
And when you become the Great
King, you will loudly proclaim
the overthrow of Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't make it easy for me, 
Shiden has <Johnny> and 
Moreau has <Fayte>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about that. My associate
has already taken care of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's time for you to rise to the top,
after losing your beloved and having
been treated poorly by the other
nations. Your Majesty the Great.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well... "YOU" will be the 
Great King of Aquaveil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've fallen for
an obvious trick.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius> was used 
or some reason, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, the
guy is... Oh well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>!	<Greybum>!
We found you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...!	You're the 
ones from Shiden!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> the Clown, makes
his surprise debut.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>... I didn't expect you to 
folloow me all this way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm just trying to fulfill my duty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must retrive the Eye of Atamoni
from you at any cost!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
You Impudent...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where is the Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't need to answer you! Your 
Highness, take care of them!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know. I'll take care of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll render your swords to dust!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe... I lost...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where's <Greybum>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's gone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Outside!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
A flying dragon?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't know it was here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where the hell did he go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is <Greybum> in that...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where'd <Greybum> run off to?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's going to Phandaria.
Bah... he set me up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like he was always planning 
to use me then toss me to the side.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Such a man is supposed to be
the Great King of Aquaveil?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a shame, <Tiberius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes... I may be even more
of a clown than you are.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I can't die like this. I am... 
the Great King of Aquaveil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> A Shiden Duel! I challenge
you to one final battle!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell are you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Alright. I accept.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
The royal family has its own way
of pulling back the curtain.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, can I borrow your
sword, just for now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Here, use mine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
If royalty are to settle scores
with each other, this treasure
sword would be appropriate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
,,,Okay, Chal?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand. If you 
say so, Young Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm in your debt.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, then, let's get started.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Johnny>. What is the 
real reason you came here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Avenging <Eleanor>'s death?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Or is it to reclaim the title of Great
King that I took from your father?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you believe me if I
told you I was just helping?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoa! Whoa!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well said, <Johnny> the Clown.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've had my fill of all of this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can have this back. I'm 
not very good with it anyway.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean you're
not familiar with it? That
wasn't the swordsmanship
of an amateur.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>, what are you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm... <Johnny>the Clown.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Master! Are you all right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've arrived just in time.
Spread the word. I've defeated
King <Tiberius>.
[ENDBLOCK]
かしこまりました！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well. Let's get out of here.
<Fayte> will be waiting for us.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
