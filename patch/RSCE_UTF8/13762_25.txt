Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, I was
attacked by a monster on
my way back to the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I was saved by <Ascus>, one
of the Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
He was actually
kind of a jerk, though...
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yo, it's been a while!
How was Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you may have mistaken 
me for someone else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, stop jerking my chain.
I want to hear about your travels.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
You really aren't
him, are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry about that...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's alright. No harm, no foul.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do I really look that similar
to this gentleman you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you could be twins.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If anyone who knew him saw you,
they would have quite the reaction.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Although last time I saw him, he
sure left town in quite a rush...
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If you want to know more about
him, you should find his friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I bet they'd mistake you
for him just like I did.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Wasn't that big hairy guy
with you the other day?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Next time you see him,
could you give him this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Aw, why did you get rid of
the braid? It really suited you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Grandson
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, General <Ashley>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
This is <Ashley>, the general
who saved our village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
General <Ashley> is wonderful!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if he'll stay and
live in our village?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
The people of this village, 
they're cheering my name!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're even calling me,
"General <Ashley>, the savior
of the village!"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have to wear
a mask anymore!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
The people of this village, 
they're cheering my name!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're even calling me,
"General <Ashley>, the savior
of the village!"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've finally left my
brother's shadow!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh yeah, the King mentioned
your brother, too, didn't he?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
My brother is <Finlay>. The founder
of the Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was an amazing man, as
skilled with people as he
was with his blade.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yet as talented as he was,
his life was a short one.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of that, people expected
me to be the same as he was, 
rather than my own person.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm...Do you
hate your brother?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Absolutely not. I adore him.
I worked hard to live up to his name.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But you could never
be him exactly, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
As expected, of course. I certainly
wasted a lot of time trying, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, though, 
you're your own man.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, that's nice of you to say.
...Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
For now, I'll continue to
protect this village
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Welcome to Armeida.
How about a rest at the inn
before heading out to the temple?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the village of Armeida, at
the foot of Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
How horrible!
Oh, Atamoni preserve us! 
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
May you all be 
blessed by the Goddess.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
Atamoni watches over our
lives from the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
Rumor has it something happened
at the temple. It might be true...
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never seen anything like this
in all my 60 years on this earth...
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
Rumor has it something happened
at the temple. It might be true...
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
What will happen to the
temple from now on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
With the help of Bishop <Ayles>, the
reconstruction of the temple seems
to be proceeding smoothly.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
At such times, the blessing of
the Atamoni is necessary.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
If we can cooperate,
we cam accomplish anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you Straylize 
Temple's pilgrims?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I recognized you right away,
cause you were dressed for the trip.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
That? It's the face
I saw somewhere.

[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
...Do you get it! Last year, 
you must have come to visit 
Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
No one has returned from the temple
in the last few days.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The story of the incident that
happened in the temple has already
reached this village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though <Greybum> is gone, 
it'll be difficult to regain 
the credibility of the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't help it if I can
show such great power...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Recently, the number of monsters
attacking the city is increasing.
What should I do?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I will do
what I can.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to leave such a lonely
village and go out to the city...
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
It's that trio, Omo, to come
back to this village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're not careful in the city,
it might be dangerous.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if my life will end without
ever going out to the city...
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll stay in this 
village forever. It's like 
they say, where you live, 
you die.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're going to Straylize Temple,
take the east road.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw a lot of priests carrying
big luggage and going down
the road.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
What was that?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that the number of people
who visit the temple has
decreased recently.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The number of people who visit
the temple has increased again.
I'm sure everyone is worried.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
When I find a worshiper, 
I say I'll go to the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
You may be attacked by
a monster and die.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!

[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have the Battle Record book?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You seem reliable enough. 
Here, take this with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Using「Definite Strike」will
makes the battle is easier.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Take good care of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You can perform a Definite Strike
by setting「Definite Strike」 
to "ON" from the Customize menu
in the Main menu.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You can also view each monster's
Definite Strike in the Monster Book
if Definite Strike is "ON".

[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I have nothing to give anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I have nothing to say to you now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Come back once you have honed
your skills some more.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>[Rock Rally] is a game in which

1: Kicking a rock outside the 
	city will start the game.
2: Battles don't affect the clearing
	objective of the Rock Rally game.
3: The rock will return to its original
	location when you enter or leave
	a city or dungeon.
