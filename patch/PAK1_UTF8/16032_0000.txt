Oh God, why are you like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
It's as I've been told...
[ENDBLOCK]
You're one heavy sleeper. You should
be ashamed of us having to wake you up!
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'm sorry...
[ENDBLOCK]
Those two are really close,
aren't they?
[ENDBLOCK]
You're very mature, <Chelsea>. You understand
the subtleties of human emotions.
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't wait to share my feelings
with you, Lord <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
It's good to have a goal.
I'm rooting for you.<x00>
