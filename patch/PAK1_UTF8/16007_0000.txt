<center>Why does <Hugo> want to revive
the Aetherian Kingdom?
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I don't know. I guess we'll have
to ask him, won't we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I wonder what he'd be happy about,
being the ruler of a world where
no one else exists.
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
Right...
[ENDBLOCK]
But one thing's for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>There is no way in hell the
world can survive the
sacrifice of so many people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>We must stop <Hugo>'s ambitions.
No matter what it takes.<x00>
