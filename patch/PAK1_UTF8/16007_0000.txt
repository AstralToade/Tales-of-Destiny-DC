[ENDBLOCK]
Why does <Hugo> want to revive
the Celestial Kingdom?
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know. I guess we'll have
to ask him, won't we?
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what he'd be happy about,
being the ruler of a world where
no one else exists.
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
Right...
[ENDBLOCK]
But one thing's for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
A world that requires the sacrifice
of so many people cannot possibly
be a happy one.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
We must stop <Hugo>'s ambitions.
No matter what it takes.<x00>
