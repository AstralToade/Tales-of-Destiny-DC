I'd say that <Lion>'s sacrifice atoned
for his crimes. I refuse to condemn him!
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't agree. What <Lion>
did was unforgivable!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah, hey! Ain't that
a little harsh?
[ENDBLOCK]
It's true that he saved us in the end, and I'm
thankful...but to part like that was simply horrid.
[ENDBLOCK]
It made us feel like
we abandoned him!
[ENDBLOCK]
...And if this keeps
up, <Rutee> will...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there something
wrong with <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, no...it's nothing.<x00>
