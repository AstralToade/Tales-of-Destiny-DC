Lord <Woodrow>!	Lord <Woodrow>!
Please respond!
[ENDBLOCK]
Please calm down, <Chelsea>.
Let's use a Life Bottle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh... I'm sorry, Lord <Woodrow>.
This happened while I was with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
If this happens again, I'll be sure
to suffer the same fate with you...
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait, don't do that! That'll cost us
an extra Life Bottle if you do.<x00>
