The celestial beings lived in
aerial cities, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure very few of them
lived a full-fledged life.
[ENDBLOCK]
Because the battle was over

...Something on your mind?
[ENDBLOCK]
I was just wondering what it felt like
to leave the land you're used to living in
and go up into the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a very subjective question.
I can't really answer that.
[ENDBLOCK]
It depends on the person.
[ENDBLOCK]
You're right... If I were alive back then,
I'm sure I would have stayed on the ground.
[ENDBLOCK]
...I guess it really depends on the person.<x00>
