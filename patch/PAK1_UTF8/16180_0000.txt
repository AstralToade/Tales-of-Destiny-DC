We finally finished the Discovery Book.
Thanks to everyone's efforts...
[ENDBLOCK]
A lot happened up to this point.
I remember so many things
[ENDBLOCK]
Looking back, there were so many things
in this world that we didn't even know existed.
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. I thought I had already seen
many sights, but I hadn't seen enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
The world is a big place.
[ENDBLOCK]
This world is a much more mysterious and enjoyable
place than what can be experienced through books.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm grateful for this opportunity. It is a requirement
for a good leader to have a broad perspective.
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish those kids could have seen this...
[ENDBLOCK]
This isn't the end.
[ENDBLOCK]
There are still things we don't know,
about us, and about other people.
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, let's go on a journey of discovery!!<x00>
