Question!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ready!
[ENDBLOCK]
Who established the country which
Aquaveil was founded upon?
[ENDBLOCK]
That's an easy question, <Philia>.
The answer is the Count Michel.
[ENDBLOCK]
In addition, the Count was a drifter from
first realm, now known as Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
How naive! Michel was a Count
and adventurer of Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, the term "drifter" is incorrect.
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that's just a theory.
[ENDBLOCK]
You're both amazing～.<x00>
