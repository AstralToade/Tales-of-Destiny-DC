<Lion>'s title, Hedge Knight...
What's that mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
It means that, though he is not officially a Knight
of the Kingdom, he is still treated like he is.

So then, it's a lot like being an Officer?
[ENDBLOCK]
That must be nice!
[ENDBLOCK]
Instead of envying someone elses circumstances,
how about focusing on bettering your own?
[ENDBLOCK]
I know, I know. I'm my own person.<x00>
