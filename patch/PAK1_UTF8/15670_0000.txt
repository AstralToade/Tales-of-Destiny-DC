It was the right decision to leave my hometown
after all. New discoveries every day.
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I'm surprised every time I come in contact
with something I don't know.
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys look like you're having fun.
[ENDBLOCK]
Is something wrong, <Rutee>?
You don't seem to be excited.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nothing. I just feel like I'm missing out because
I'm the only one who wasn't impressed.<x00>
