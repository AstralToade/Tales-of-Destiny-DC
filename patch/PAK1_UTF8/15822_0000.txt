When I talk to you～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
It reminds me of the cold～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
That icy glare's the cue～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
To make the teardrops roll～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, make him stop singing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't it great? I'm loving this!
[ENDBLOCK]
If you dare step out of line～
[ENDBLOCK]
Like him you'll feel real small～
[ENDBLOCK]
He hides his true nature behind～
[ENDBLOCK]
A massive, icy wall～
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, wonder who this song's about.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guess at your own risk.
[ENDBLOCK]
I bet we'll never know～
[ENDBLOCK]
What he's really like at all～
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah～♪
