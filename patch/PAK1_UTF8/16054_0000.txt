<Johnny>, how do you
come up with your songs?
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a great question.
Look over there.
[ENDBLOCK]
That's <Philia> and <Kongman>, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, <Kongman> just
offered her a flower.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia> gently refused it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman> sure looks depressed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>'s No. 11,
"<Kongman>'s Broken Heart".
[ENDBLOCK]
Along with the flowers～♪
I'll scatter too～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
I see now.<x00>
