[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That man?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. Even though he is a<__>civilian employee, he is the one<__>who thinks about safety and<__>happiness first.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't know.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>

It's a surprising fact. The next<__>time we meet, We'll make fun of<__>this story.<00>

[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia><00>

No wonder.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you were shown such an aerial<__>city and even attacked...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sordian Masters! What the<__>hell is this?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow... such a huge building is<__>floating in the sky!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds><00>

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the true nature of the<__>light released from Dycroft.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
The purpose is to destroy the ground,<__>as it is in the street.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
You said the aerial city was used<__>in the Tenchi war...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The Aeth'er Wars...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I have no choice but to tell<__>you the truth.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
A thousand years ago, there was a<__>great war involving all humankind.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was the ground forces to which we<__>belonged and as such the Heavenly<__>Army of the aerial city.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
So the Aeth'er War...! It wasn't<__>just a legend, was it?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Atamoni's Eye played a big role<__>in the Aeth'er War.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was,ÅuA sword caught in a<__>worldwide calamityÅv.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I 'm sorry I didn't<__>say anything.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
We wanted to erase the memory of<__>the Aeth'er war from the<__>history of mankind.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not to repeat, the mistakes<__>of the past.<00>

But as a result, the aerial<__>city has been revived...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
People of the earthly world!<__>Do you see our power?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>...What are you doing?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
What you see above you is the<__>aerial city of the Aeth'er War.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That we have revived from a<__>thousand years long sleep!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
We do not forgive at all.<__>No exceptions are allowed.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It does not allow the people of<__>the earthly world who can only<__>crawl on the ground like insects.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will confine everything on the<__>earthly world to the darkness.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please wait with trembling expectations!<__>Mwahahaha!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Hugo>. Are you going to pretend<__>to be the king of the heavenly<__>world!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
The way he talks is<__>like that man.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
What should I do now?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if you use the Draconis, you<__>can not reach that aerial city...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there no way for us to compete?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No, not yet!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
As it is... Can I be left alone!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can you hear me, <Hugo>ÅI<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who will make you like it!<__>Who will do what you want!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will definitely be rewarded...!<__><Lion>'s enemies will definitely be taken!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you understand!<__>Remember, <Hugo>ÅI<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haha...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
ÅHÅHÅHÅH<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That spirit, young master.<__>well said!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It can't be.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That kind of...It can't be.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, this voice<__>is unmistakable.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
ÅHÅHÅHÅH<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordian team, it's not a<__>case of depressed!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
ÅHÅHÅHÅH<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
We still have the potential!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Who?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mercurius <Ritora>.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was the one who once led<__>us as the commander of the<__>ground forces.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
In case of an emergency, I also<__>transcribed my personality to<__>the core crystal.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where does your voice come from...?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
The communication function that is<__>built into me is being used.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, I'm in the heart of Radisrol.<__>The strategy meeting is carried<__>out immediately from this.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gather the Swordian team and<__>hurry to Radisrol!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is the first call order<__>in a thousand years.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure you'll get by, right?<__>We can still do something<__>about it, right?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, <Stahn> Aileron.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be afraid under any<__>circumstances! Use all means<__>to accomplish your mission!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the Swordian team!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, I understand!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, let's head<__>right out away.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have already picked up the sea<__>dragon. Try going outside.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Radisrol was moved to the sea.<__>Waiting for arrival.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Excellency, I would like to<__>work with them to gather information.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, you have permission.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whew. I thought I'd be able to<__>go home soon, but I didn't go<__>that way.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have to see Atamoni's<__>Eye sealed.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to the advice of the<__>Swordians, we were able to<__>create a perfect sealing facility.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the future, the troops of Japan,<__>Seingard, and both countries will<__>also be stationed. Rest assured.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I did everything I could do in<__>this era. I have no choice but<__>to believe it.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I and <Chelsea>,<__>will return through Janos.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, please come visit us<__>again in Phandaria.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Feel free to drop in at the castle.<__>You guys are always welcome.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please leave <Mary> and<__>others to us.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure I'll go visit<__>them again.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Until then!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Then I will return to<__>the temple soon.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...It was really hard. Good work.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't all like that. When it<__>was over, it was a fun trip.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
For me, who knew only inside<__>the temple, it was a good opportunity<__>to know the outside world.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's because everyone gave me<__>an opportunity. I am grateful.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Likewise. Thanks to you,<__>it really helped me.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Well then, good luck.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegald Soldier<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Stahn>. Excuse Me...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's right.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must apologize, I'm sorry I have to say goodbye, <Dymlos>.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
The next time we meet, I'll be stronger. Please look forward to it.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no guarantee that I<__>will be here when you return.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I find a better person,<__>I'll switch quickly.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jeez. You could feel a little sad<__>I'm going...Well then!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Ah.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos> won't show it himself, either.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, what are you going to do now?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
What else? I'll<__>await further orders.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've done a lot already. You<__>should take some time to rest.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Such is my duty<__>as a Hedge Knight.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad I was able to travel with<__>you, <Lion>. We went through a lot,<__>but it was fun.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What are you doing?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What are you doing?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you mimic me!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Come on, <Lion>.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all that, you still<__>dislike me that much?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's..<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I consider you to be<__>a good friend, <Lion>.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh..!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't waste your breath.<__>I'll say this one more time.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't stand laid-back, careless,<__>overly-friendly people like you.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...But...fine, I suppose<__>I can make a small exception.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is kinda nice.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
..Hmph.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegald Soldier<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Stahn>, the Draconis is ready.<__>We can depart at any time.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I should say goodbye to <Rutee>...<__>Wonder where she went?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw her in the<__>castle a while ago.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'll go look for her.<__>Excuse me, can you wait for a while?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
notice<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Rerise is no longer<__>possible due to the absence<__>of Swordian.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a busy guy.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are <Stahn> and <Rutee>?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't butt in.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
But it's about Bochan's older sister.<__>Do you not care about it?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
... I don't care.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, <Rutee> and I are<__>essentially strangers.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Rather than that. Let's go back<__>to the mansion.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]

<Marian> is waiting.<00>
